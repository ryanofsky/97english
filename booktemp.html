    against the philosophy of most public and private schools in our society. Our schools try
    to give everybody the same education. That's why every class uses the same textbooks and
    does the same projects and learns in the same order. On a larger scale, this is also why
    there is such a push for national standardization and testing. In a transcendental school,

    transcendental school. you have the option of learning a lot more about specific topics
    over a general view over everything else. So, there certainly is a big difference between
    a transcendental school and we we have now. I think the best thing for me would be a
    combination of both. In younger grades, I didn't really know what my interests were. So it
    was definitely good that I was exposed to English, History, Math, Science, and music. But
    now that I'm in high school I would much rather prefer a transcendental type
    education.&nbsp; I hate this class. I hate Spanish, I hate gym, I hate the government
    class. I have no interest in any of the things we are</font></strong></td>
