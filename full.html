<p>Here is the printout you requested. I hope you are planning to look at the actual
website. I think I did a pretty decent job with at least that part of the project. (And
the tiny books make everything look much longer) And of course, there are sound effects
and things that move. How could you stand to miss something like that?</p>

<p>Introduction 2:</p>

<p>Hello, and welcome to the library. Just click a book to open it and start reading.
You'll find something different in every book. I started out with the cheesy topics. Ex:
10 Cool Words and as I become less and less awake I begin to do actual writing about
topics. It gets worse as I get sleepier, however and by the end I am making even less
sense than when I was at the beginning. Oh well. Here's 20 writings. Count em.</p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">Yeah yeah yeah. I know you've seen it. But I'm
throwing it in anyway to look at in 25 years. I was going to write another thing about
school, but why not use this one? (By the way. I think you misunderstood it the first
time. I don't hate English, just this class. Now that we've go that straightened out...)</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">Transcendentalism goes against the philosophy
of most public and private schools in our society. Our schools try to give everybody the
same education. That's why every class uses the same textbooks and does the same projects
and learns in the same order. On a larger scale, this is also why there is such a push for
national standardization and testing. In a transcendental school, every student would
receive a different education, depending on interests and strength. Also, public schools
prefer a broad education with a little bit of everything. We have required credits in
every subject area. In a transcendental school. you have the option of learning a lot more
about specific topics over a general view over everything else. So, there certainly is a
big difference between a transcendental school and we we have now. I think the best thing
for me would be a combination of both. In younger grades, I didn't really know what my
interests were. So it was definitely good that I was exposed to English, History, Math,
Science, and music. But now that I'm in high school I would much rather prefer a
transcendental type education.&nbsp; I hate this class. I hate Spanish, I hate gym, I hate
the government class. I have no interest in any of the things we are learning. On the
other hand I like to read, I want to stay physically fit, and I think you have to have
some basic knowledge of the government. In a transcendental school, I could explore these
areas more, and get more out of them. And for the Physics / Chemistry / Math / Computer
Science courses that I do like, I would have more of an opportunity to go deeper into
these areas, do more projects, and read more. And I could have more of an opportunity to
think more and come up with things myself, rather than having ideas predefined and
spoon-fed to me.</font></strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">Conformity</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">In our everybody vs. Matt Kelly discussions
about conformity, we wanted him to conform to our opinion that conformity was not a good
thing. Matt Kelly had the opinion that conformity was good because there is less pressure
to stand out and do something original and that it makes things simpler and easier.
Everybody else says that conforming means giving up individuality and identity. As usual,
all I have to say is, Who Cares? If you want to conform, then go ahead an conform. If you
don't, then don't, don't! It's an individual decision. I don't thing we'll ever see the
day when everybody conforms. And if everybody doesn't conform, not conforming will lose
its fun. So if Matt Kelly wants to go against the group and say that conforming is good
and everybody else wants Matt to go with the popular opinion and not conform, then that's
just fine too.</font></strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">Who Cares?</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">Hmm. While doing that conformity thing I
noticed that my opinion on that and a lot of other issues is Who Cares? A lot of issues
that people would call controversial are to me just individual choices or&nbsp; subjective
observations. I'm talking about the conformity thing, what is art, opinions on food, music
clothing, religion. But don't worry about that. I've got several more writings coming up
with the Who Cares opinion. The purpose of this one though is to try to find some kind of
word for this whole who cares thing, preferably something that ends in -ism. I don't have
a very big vocabulary, so if you know any real words or want to make up a word like
whocaresism, type it here and click the save button.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">Drugs, Tobacco, Alcohol, and Burger King</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">Drugs, Tobacco, Alcohol, and Burger King. All
of these things make people happy then make them die. Of course they do these to varying
extents, but it is basically the same thing all around. Drugs: these are pretty illegal.
We spend billions of dollars tracking down drug shipments, arresting dealers, and putting
people in jail, but the fact remains: If you want drugs, there isn't much in your way that
would prevent you from getting them. The same thing goes for tobacco and underage alcohol.
Despite taxes and laws: if you want it, you can get it. What we need is a little
whocaresienism. If people are going to do it anyway, then why bother with all the
enforcement? And, according to foreign language teachers, whocaresienism may even improve
the situation. Drunk driving and teen drinking are much less of a problem for many other
countries where there are no age restriction.</font></strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">What is art?</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">My Spanish teacher told us the names of the top
five paintings. There are five paintings that experts have established are better then
everything else. They all agree. If you like #3 better than #2 you're wrong. Apparently,
the same thing goes for literature. There are 2.5 American books that are better than all
other American books. All of this is completely stupid. If&nbsp; would say that Michael
Crieton kills Nathaniel Hawthorne, what is wrong with that? I have great respect for good
artists and writers. But, the so-called experts who sit around and analyze, making lists
of plant imagery and ranking works, What is the point? What are they accomplishing? It is
good that they can appreciate a piece of art of literature, but to pretend any of that
stuff is really important or treat it as if it was some kind of exact science is pretty
ridiculous.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">What I Did This Weekend and the Thursday Even
Though Thursday Wasn't Really A Part of This Weekend Which I Am Now Writing About</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">The beginning of this week was all crappy and
rainy. It was not much fun. But I sure had a great time this weekend and Thursday. Oh the
stories I have to tell. I could go on and on and on. This weekend and Thursday were great
fun. How much fun? A lot, I can tell you that much. Yes, this weekend and Thursday were
very pleasant. I really enjoyed this weekend and Thursday. How do I describe the amount of
fun that occurred during this weekend and Thursday? Well, this weekend and Thursday can
really be broken down into four parts: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and January.
Thursday was the physics trip to Hersheypark. We used timers to measure the speed of the
roller coasters. And I got to hold the accelerometer on the scary carousel ride. Oh no, I
still haven't done those calculations that are due tomorrow. Why waste brainpowers at 2 am
on English? Hold on a second. ... Ok, that's taken care of. Friday was not good. All my
friends did not come to school because they were (um) sick And since I was out of the loop
on Thursday, I was not sick too. After that though I met them at the mall. Luke was in a
very good mood because he had just run into our wonderful english teacher.Then we went to
salvation army and bought crazy clothes for later. Two people bought dresses and I got
some bright yellow pants and a strechy pink and green tee shirt with a zipper and two rows
of buttons that didn't attach to anything. Then we went to the bowling alley in our crazy
getup to freak out some bowlers. We brought a video camera and I got a strike. (god damn I
am sleepy) January was cold, but I don't know what that has to do with anything.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">God</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">95% of people in the world believe in a God
(according the the movie, Contact). Only 60% of scientists believe in God (or was it 40%?,
from a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed)</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">The word, 'faith' has a good connotation. I
think 'faith' is terrible. How is it a good thing to believe something without question or
thought?</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">Observations and data do not suggest the
presence of a god. If there is absolutely no trace of a god then how do you say one
exists. You have the burden of proof.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">My parents say that right now I might not
believe in god, but that I will when I get older.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">Why would god waste his time on us?</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">The Universe is Big</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">Well, it's true isn't it? Who the hell cares
what I was like 25 years ago? Why is it that every five minutes in english class (no so
much in this one, but I've have at least 10 since 9th grade and 4 or 5 from advanced comp.
and I've avoided doing that in this book) I have to write about something that happened
when I was <em>young</em> or in my <em>childhood</em>? I'M TOO YOUNG TO REMINISCE!! I'm
only 16 years old. Why should I be mulling around all day thinking about &quot;the good
old days&quot; or &quot;when life was easy&quot;? I don't know. To me, the future seems
much more interesting. Stupid middle aged teachers...</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">WOw. I've been raving like a god damn fool for
those last couple of topics. Well, I must say those writings look pretty shabby. I guess
its all right. There is no logic or support for any of the things I am saying. But...
that's the price of procrastination. I don't have time to add my reasons. Actually it
doesn't matter, this is just a little booklet for me in 25 years. I'm just writing down my
opinions, not defending them. So that's all good. (However, if anyone's reading this and
wants to disagree... my email is <a href="mailto:russman99@usa.net">russman99@usa.net</a>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Contemporary Brush">English Class, Strange Moments In:</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Contemporary Brush"><b>Essay / Speech about An Object with
Special Meaning<br>
</b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font face="Contemporary Brush"><b>The Mighty Paper Clip</b></font></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">I must confess that when I walked into my
English class last Tuesday the object I had brought to share my memories and feelings for,
the object that would reveal the meaning of life, the object I had chosen, was only a
paper clip. Of course, I had plans to find something more suitable the next day. But
during that class period I began to like the idea a little more. The problem was I still
could not think of any sort of memory, experience, or interesting thing to say about it. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">So that night, I went right over to the Camp
Hill Mall. There is this lady who hangs out there in the arcade who is some kind of drug
dealer / psychic. I don&#146;t do drugs, but I was hoping that maybe I could use her
psychic abilities to recover some lost memories about paper clips. So she took me to her
office, and tried out several treatments. She hypnotized me, tried some electric shock
therapy, and put me in front of this strange machine with mysterious sounds and lights.
Actually, I think she was just playing Sonic the Hedgehog, but I was unable to tell
without my glasses. Anyway, none of it seemed to work. But suddenly, when she was on the
phone with some sort of &quot;unlicensed brain surgeon&quot;, the memories came flooding
back, and tears came to my eyes&#133; I will share one of these memories here.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">When I was 5 years old, I didn&#146;t go to
public school but to some tiny religious school in Harrisburg. Since there were only three
or four people from this school who lived on the West Shore, we got to ride on one of
those vans that say &quot;School Students,&quot; instead of a bus. And except for the fact
that the radio was constantly blaring &quot;Tim and Sue and the Wink Morning Zoo,&quot; it
was not bad. But one day, when we were on a bridge over the Susquehanna river, something
happened and the car swerved to the side of the road. Before we even realized what was
going on, the car had flown over the guardrail and we were in midair over the river.
Thinking quickly, I took a long chain of paper clips out of my bookbag, fastened one end
to a seat, and threw the other end out of the window, and up to the bridge. Luckily for us
it caught some other section of the guardrail. But our troubles were not over. Although
the paper clip chain was more than capable of supporting the weight of the van, the
guardrail was creaking and was about to crumble. Once again, I sprung into action. I
climbed up into the front of the van, shattered the windshield with my fist, and ascended
up the long chain of paper clips. Once I was at the top, I took hold of the chain, and
used every bit of my strength to pull the van back up to safety. I had not only saved my
own life but also the lives of three others, and all thanks to paper clips.</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">But now that I look back on that incident, I
now understand that I owe more to paper clips than just my life. Thanks to them, and this
English class, I have come to believe that the hidden meaning, the ultimate purpose in our
lives is in fact: </font></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">SCOTTISH HIGHLAND DANCING. </font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">You may be skeptical now, but read on. Soon,
you too will see how no life is complete without beloved highland dances like &quot;<em>Strathspey
and Reels&quot;</em>,<i> </i>&quot;<em>Wilt Thou go the Barracks, Johnnie?&quot; and
&quot;The Highland Laddie.&quot; </em>Let me explain how I came upon this ultimate truth.
I noticed that when rearranged, the letters in PAPER CLIP spell PA CRIPPLE, CAP PER LIP,
and CLAP PIPER. While most of these combinations are probably pure coincidence, I had a
hunch that CLAP PIPER would lead me to the truth. I thought about it for a very long time.
CLAP and PIPER, what was the connection, and what was the meaning of life? But I
couldn&#146;t think of anything, and I decided I need a break. So, I decided to relax and
visit <i>The Minnesota Scottish Celtic Dance Association Home Page</i> to catch up on all
the latest news and read some more fun facts about those crazy highland dances. But little
did I know that the connection between CLAP and PIPER and the path that would lead me to
the ultimate meaning of life was right before my eyes. The sentence read: &quot;The clap
is a signal from the dancer to the piper that the piper is supposed to change tempo for a
quick step.&quot; &quot;Of course,&quot; I thought, &quot;the meaning of life is to go
Scottish Highland Dancing!&quot; The ultimate meaning of life had been lost in the seeming
simplicity of the paper clip, perhaps since ancient times, but I had uncovered it!!</font></strong></p>

<p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">I am so happy that I&#146;ve had this time to
explore the greatness of the paper clip. The time I&#146;ve spend working on this has been
the most fulfilling and rewarding experience of my life. I&#146;ve come to see paper clips
as more than a twisty piece of metal that comes in many colors and sizes. Paper clips are
our wiry friends that attach one piece of paper to another, save lives, and have so much
to teach us. Stop reading, Right Now and Hug a Paper Clip.</font></strong></p>
