<p><strong><small><font face="Verdana">It is a beautiful day outside. The sun is shining,
the sky is clear, the grass is green and other good stuff is going on. I can think of no
better way of enjoying this fine day than sitting in my basement in front of a computer
screen churning out 19 writings (yes, this introduction counts) for an english class. Oh,
this is going to be so wonderful. I can't believe how lucky I am. </font></small></strong></p>

<p><strong><small><font face="Verdana">But when I'm am done it will all be worth it.
Because in 25 years I will come back to this project and laugh. No more english for me!
Mrs. Scott is dead! And I will laugh and laugh and laugh Ha hA HA!! </font></small></strong></p>
