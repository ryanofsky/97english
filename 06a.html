    face="Contemporary Brush">In our everybody vs. Matt Kelly discussions about conformity, we
    wanted him to conform to our opinion that conformity was not a good thing. Matt Kelly had
    the opinion that conformity was good because there is less pressure to stand out and do
    something original and that it makes things simpler and easier. Everybody else says that
    conforming means giving up individuality and identity. As usual, all I have to say is, Who
    Cares? If you want to conform, then go ahead an conform. If you don't, then don't, don't!
    It's an individual decision. I don't thing we'll ever see</font></strong></td>

    face="Contemporary Brush">&nbsp;</font></strong><p><strong><font face="Contemporary Brush">the
    day when everybody conforms. And if everybody doesn't conform, not conforming will lose
    its fun. So if Matt Kelly wants to go against the group and say that conforming is good
    and everybody else wants Matt to go with the popular opinion and not conform, then that's
    just fine too.</font></strong></td>
