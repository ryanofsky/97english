    much fun. But I sure had a great time this weekend and Thursday. Oh the stories I have to
    tell. I could go on and on and on. This weekend and Thursday were great fun. How much fun?
    A lot, I can tell you that much. Yes, this weekend and Thursday were very pleasant. I
    really enjoyed this weekend and Thursday. How do I describe the amount of fun that
    occurred during this weekend and</font></strong></td>

    face="Contemporary Brush"> Thursday? Well, this weekend and Thursday can really be broken
    down into four parts: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and January. Thursday was the
    physics trip to Hersheypark. We used timers to measure the speed of the roller coasters.
    And I got to hold the accelerometer on the scary carousel ride. Oh no, I still haven't
    done those calculations that are due tomorrow. Why waste brainpowers at 2 am on English?
    Hold on a second. ... Ok, that's taken care of. Friday was not good. All my friends did
    not come to school because they were (um) sick And since I was out of the loop on
    Thursday, I was not sick too. After that though I met them at the mall. Luke</font></strong></td>
